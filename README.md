   One Punch Man - Landing Page
</h1>

This project was inspired by the challenge proposed by Alexandre Santos in his youtube tutorial. I accepted the challenge and created this landing page of Saitama from the anime One Punch Man, using HTML and CSS.

I customized the design with the character's colors, added an effect to the form's button and this was the result. I enjoyed it a lot!
